			<h2>Regulations</h2>
			<p>Spearfishing comes with important rules and regulations that help keep both divers and marine life safe. Every region has its own laws, so it’s always a good idea to check local guidelines before heading out. These rules often include limits on the types and sizes of fish you can catch, as well as designated areas where spearfishing is allowed or restricted. Some places may also require a fishing license or specific gear restrictions, like banning scuba-assisted spearfishing.</p>

			<h2>Sustainability</h2>
			<p>One of the best things about spearfishing is that it can be very sustainable when done right. You’re choosing exactly which fish to take, so there’s no waste or harm to other sea life. Most spearfishers follow local rules and only take what they need, leaving the rest to keep the ocean balanced. It’s a mindful way to fish — one that respects nature and helps protect marine ecosystems for the future.</p>

			<h2>Skills</h2>
			<p>Spearfishing takes more than just diving underwater with a spear. It’s about learning to move calmly and quietly, holding your breath, and becoming part of the underwater world. Most spearfishers use freediving, which means no scuba tanks — just your lungs and your focus. It takes practice, patience, and a clear mind. The better your breath control and awareness, the better your chances of finding and catching fish safely.</p>
