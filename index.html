        <h2>Gear</h2>
        <p>Spearfishing is an exciting way to connect with the ocean, but having the right gear makes all the difference. Most people use a speargun or pole spear to catch fish, along with a mask and snorkel so they can see and breathe easily underwater. Fins help you glide through the water with less effort, and a wetsuit keeps you warm and protected. Many also wear a weight belt to stay balanced, gloves for safety, and carry a small knife for handling their catch. A float or dive flag is handy too, keeping you visible to boats and giving you a place to rest when needed./p>

        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <p>Spearfishing comes with important rules to keep both the diver and the ocean safe. Always check local regulations, like which species you can catch, size limits, and seasonal restrictions. Never dive alone, and always use a float or dive flag so boats can see you. Respect the environment by avoiding fragile reefs and only taking what you can use. Safety and conservation go hand in hand, making the experience better for everyone./p>

        <h2>Sustainability</h2>
        <p>Sustainable spearfishing is all about taking only what you need and protecting the ocean for the future. This means targeting abundant species, avoiding overfished or endangered ones, and respecting size and bag limits. It also involves being careful around reefs and marine life, so habitats stay healthy./p>
